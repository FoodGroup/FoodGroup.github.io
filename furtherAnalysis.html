		<p>In “How to Make a National Cuisine: Cookbooks in Contemporary India” Arjun Appadurai explores how cookbooks in India both capture and shape national Indian food identity. For instance, in India, cookbooks are generally authored by urban, educated women who can lack an overall understanding of regional nuance in India or unintentionally focus on the region most familiar to them. Therefore, the national cuisine constructed through these cookbooks, doesn't necessary reflect society completely accurately. Furthermore, a national cuisine arises from the interaction of different regional cuisines, making a true national cuisine difficult if not impossible to decipher.</p>
		<p>“The idea of an “Indian” cuisine has emerged because of, rather than despite, the increasing articulation of regional and ethnic cuisines. As in other modalities of identity and ideology in emergent nations, cosmopolitan and parochial expressions enrich and sharpen each other by dialectical interaction. Especially in culinary matters, the melting pot is a myth” (Appadurai 18).</p>
		<p>While physical books were the dominant means of social expression in Appadurai’s day, today, thirty years later, Instagram and other social media have become the dominant social expression. In recent years, thousands of Instagram food influencers have gained popularity, with followers numbering from a few thousands to millions. Each social media influence offers a snapshot into their personal (and therefore somewhat regional in nature) cuisine. By looking at many Instagram influencers and the way they interact with each other, general trends about the food culture in the United States can be identified.</p>
		<h4 id="Background">Our influencers</h4>
		<p>We selected two instagram influencers for our analysis: @gatherfeast and @thehungrygentlemen. We chose one male influencer and one female influencer as a way of highling gender difference in food identity. The influencers also appeal to different social classes: upper middle class and ultra wealthy. Food choices influenced by poverty are less glorified and advertised and therefore we were unable to select influences from a lower social class.</p>
		<h4>Mediums of Representation</h4>
		<p>Both influencers are Instagrammers, using photography of their food as a medium to represent the food they eat and appeal to their respective audiences. Instagram is a platform designed around the sharing of photos. As instagrammers, both use pictures as their main medium with a supplementary caption for those who want additional details. The captions contain information about the food, or the recipe and usually run in relay with the image that the influencer has posted, hence drawing in the audience’s attention and using the images as a draw for them to explore the content of their pages. </p>
		<p>@thehungrygentleman mainly focuses on the food, placing it in the center of the picture. The food also takes 50% of the frame, making it the main focus of the picture. The only other thing noticeable in the background is his extensive collection of luxury, designer shoes, purposely highlighting his economic status. His pictures use high saturation and exposure, making them bright and eye-catching, and highlighting the food. The other accounts tagged on the account, are usually famous food influencers or luxury brands such as Balenciaga and Gucci, which further drawing the reader's attention to his economic status. </p>
		<p>@gatherandfeast uses a more varied format, using different angles for her food — close-ups, layout with a dark background and high exposure. She uses different angles for the same dish, and usually uses a light fixture for her pictures. She also had some food demonstration videos posted on her instagram that taught her followers basic recipes that are very easy to make. She is rarely seen in the pictures, except maybe her hand or a bit of her outfit, that add a homely and human touch to her food pictures. This allows her readers to interact with her posts, as they look at the tags on the image, the caption - which usually has the recipe - as well as the hashtags on the account. </p>
		<h4 id="Gender">Analysis</h4>
		<p>For our analysis of the influencers we examined how social class hierarchies and gender roles are present in the influencers content. </p>
		<p>In “Domestic divo,” Swenson identifies gender roles portrayed and reinforced by The Food Network. For women, cooking a domestic duty with emphasis on practicality and nourishment for the family. For men, cooking in an individual focuses hobby where complex social matrices are erected to protect masculinity. These definitions are clearly seen in through our influencers. @Gatherandfeast shares recipes as a labor of love, with and emphasis on cooking practical and nourishing meals for ones loved ones. @thehungrygentleman focuses on food and cooking as an individual experience of taste with no consideration for nutrition or expense.</p>
		<h4>Gender roles through ingredients</h4>
		<p>@gatherandfeast focus on healthy ingredients such as vegetables and whole grains. When possible she opts for healthier version of options such as lentil pasta over regular pasta. Additionally, through her recipes, she even explores ways to make desserts healthier, such as incorporate veggies into brownies. She shows a sensitivity to the diverse tastes and diets by offering vegetarian and vegan options. </p>
		<p>@thehungrygentleman showcases meat-and-fried-food-centric food composed of extravagant and exotic ingredients with taste of utmost importance. Meat appears in virtually all of the meals excluding the desserts. Taste is always chosen over health. He uses buttery brioche buns over whole wheat and only includes vegetables in small quantities when they accentuate the unhealthy centerpiece. Many ingredients he uses are hard to find or prohibitively expensive such as truffles or wagyu beef. </p>
		<p>@gatherandfeast healthy, practical cuisine reinforces the traditional role of women to provide nourishing meals to her family.  Additionally, it highlights the restrictive pressure placed on women by society to be thin and healthy.</p>
		<p>@thehungrygentleman seems to be affected by the concept of “meat as manly,” never even considering preparing meatless meals. His emphasis on taste over health and practicality illustrates the freedom men are able to approach food with. For him, food is a purely sensual experience, and his lack of regard for healthy and price of ingredients highlight the fundamental different relationship men have with food. </p>
		<h4>Gender roles through emphasis and aesthetics </h4>
		<p>@gatherandfeast shares recipes (often multiple versions to meet diverse needs), intending that they will be recreated by her audience. The recipes on her website are usually intended to serve  4 or more people emphasizing eating as something done in a group of loved ones or family. On her website she takes time to answer recipe relation questions of her audience to assist them in making the dish. @thehungrygentleman present his “signature” take, only offer lists of the fancy ingredients inside, but not sharing them in a recipe for with quantities and procedures. His pictures always depict a single serving, suggesting he adheres more to an individualistic male food experience. There is also a large number of photos of food from restaurants, promoting a food experience that exists largely outside of the home. @gatherandfeast goal is to share help tips and recipes to make preparing food for loved on easier. @thehungrygentleman is career focused, showcases his ability as a professional chef, often asking thanking his audience in helping him further his career. In some ways, @thehungrygentleman use this professionalism is reminiscent of the professionalism documented in “Domestic Divo” to protect masculinity.</p>
		<h4 id="Social">Social class through ingredients</h4>
		<p>@gatherandfeast used food that can easily be found at a mid to upper end grocery store for a reasonable price. It is important to note, however, that her ingredients are not accessible to everyone. Abundant fresh vegetables and lentil pasta are higher ticket items that those under the middle class would struggle to have access to. </p>
		<p>@thehungrygentleman has a diet that seems designed to advertise his status. He uses a multitude of ultra expensive items such as truffles ($1520 per lb), lobster ($30 per lb), and wagyu beef ($110 per lb). These ingredients alone suggests he belongs to an ultra wealthy social class, unattainable to most. When he does use ingredients that are universally accessible, he selects a high-end or fancy version of it. Instead of salt he has “maldon salt.”  Instead of normal BBQ sauce he has “cherry BBQ sauce.” </p>
		<p>@thehungrygentleman, especially, highlights the way in the food one eats is a way of distinguishing them from lower class. Historically, meat was a symbol of wealth. However, as meat has become ubiquitous, the cost and quality of meat is now used as the distinguishing factor. </p>
		<h4>Social class through emphasis and aesthetics </h4>
		<p>@thehungrygentleman has a supplemental emphasis on designer shoes in every single photo. His collection, containing dozens of designer shoes (mentioned above), many of which are worth more than $1000 is a blatant display of wealth. </p>
		<h4 id="Conclusion">Conclusion: How do these two influencers shape national Cuisine?</h4>
		<p>Ultimately, these influencers emphasize the diversity of food experiences in the United States. What one eats is largely dependent on factors out of one's control such as economic status, gender, and larger societal frameworks which is illustrated by “Make good choices.” While our group was able to identify key differences between influencers based on gender and social class we were unable to construct a national cuisine because we only examined two influencers.
