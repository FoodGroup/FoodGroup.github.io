		<h2>SOCIAL CLASS</h2>
		<div class="flex-container">
			<div>
				<ul type=circle>
					<p>@gatherandfeast</p>
					<li>Offers vegan and vegetarian alternatives to each recipe, which will often entail more expensive ingredients</li>
					<li>Shares a recipe</li>
					<li>Uses ingredients that are easy to find in grocery stores</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<ul type=circle>
					<p>@thehungrygentleman</p>
					<li>Either buys from restaurants or makes own food from luxurious ingredients such as truffle, shrimp, and lobster</li>
					<li>Shares his “signature” with no recipe</li>
					<li>Obvious focus on his shoes in the photos, denotes his enjoyment of material goods</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2>GENDER</h2>
		<div class="flex-container">
			<div>
				<ul type=circle>
					<p>@gatherandfeast</p>
					<li>Instagram handle implies cooking for the family; on her website there are portion sizes that feed 12-24 people</li>
					<li>Provides vegan/vegetarian recipes, which plays into the stereotype of more women being veg and the expectation of women to cater to the needs of vegan/ vegetarian family members</li>
					<li>Focus on relatively practical, easy to make meals</li>
					<li>Focus on healthy food, or more healthy versions of desserts</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<ul type=circle>
					<p>@thehungrygentleman</p>
					<li>Instagram handle implies individualism and eating alone rather than with a family and “macho man” image of males that are always hungry and eating a lot</li>
					<li>Portion sizes are enormous</li>
					<li>Some of his meals are referred to as “My ____” implying that he cooked them. This shows the connection to men cooking if they’re a chef</li>
					<li>Cooking for status and the establishment of his brand</li>
					<li>Focus on eating experience, not health</li>
				</ul>
